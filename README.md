Automate The Boring Stuff (ATBS) - Web-Scrap
New repo for me to learn and practice on GitHub familiarization and Python web scraping from Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Swegart.

This repo covers 3 python module example from ATBS - Requests, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium

Requests
- A third party module for downloading web pages and files
- requests.get() returns a Response object.
- raise_for_status() Response method will raise an exception if downloads failed.
- you can save a downloaded file to your hard drive with calls to iter_content() method
